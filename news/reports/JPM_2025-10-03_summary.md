### Oil
Brent fell to $64.53/bbl from $69.22/bbl last week, indicating near-term weakness in crude prices.

### Crack Spread
September ethylene contracts settled down 1 c/lb at 31 c/lb and September PE contracts were flat at 78 c/lb; Exxon delayed a proposed ethylene/PE cracker project citing weak market conditions, reducing near-term supply additions.

### Gas/LNG
U.S. natural gas rose w/w from $2.84/mmBTU to $3.32/mmBTU.

### Urea
Indian demand (RCF tender for 2m t) is supporting urea values with NOLA urea flat at $380/st fob ($420/t) while Brazil and Egyptian prices rose modestly; Chinese export intentions remain unclear and pending U.S. tariff cases could exert downside risk.

### NPK
Potash markets are quiet with flat prices and low volumes (Brazil ~$360/t cfr; Asia $360-380/t cfr; Nola $325/st fob) while sellers divert tons to other geographies and ~6m t of new African capacity is planned.

### DAP
DAP/MAP prices were largely unchanged (India DAP $780/t cfr; Nola DAP $770/st fob; Brazil MAP $710/t cfr) but phosphate feedstocks are rising—October ammonia up $50/t to $590/t and sulfur up to ~$310/lt—pressuring margins.

### Grain
U.S. Sept 1 corn stocks came in at 1,532m bu, raising 2025/26 beginning stocks and the stocks-to-use ratio to 14.4%; harvest progress advanced (~18% corn, 19% soy) and China has not bought U.S. soybeans since May amid a 23% tariff, reducing export demand.
