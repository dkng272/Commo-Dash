### Oil
Brent rose week-over-week from $65.50/bbl to $66.99/bbl.

### Crack Spread
Dow postponed a Gulf Coast cracker turnaround and Gulf Coast crackers are running at ~95%, PE prices rolled over flat in July-August and Dow sees potential positive price action in September, supporting margin dynamics.

### Gas/LNG
U.S. natural gas fell from $3.05/mmBTU to $2.94/mmBTU week-over-week, and natural gas curtailments have contributed to ammonia supply tightness in places like Trinidad.

### Urea
India purchased ~2.1m tons of urea at $460-$465/t cfr (with up to ~800kt likely from China); North African urea eased about $20/t to ~$410/t fob, US barge ~ $400/st flattish, and Brazil fell to $430/t cfr, with above-average monsoon rains in India providing some price support.

### NPK
Potash markets are snug with Asian cfr around $380/t and low China port stocks while phosphate/DAP is softer; overall fertilizer fundamentals are mixed with near-term tightness in potash and modest weakness in phosphate products.

### DAP
India DAP eased by a few dollars to just over $800/t cfr, Morocco is selling DAP to Europe at $805/t cfr, and NOLA DAP softened about $5/t to $780/st fob.

### Container Shipping
The U.S. elimination of the de minimis exemption led major carriers (FedEx, UPS, DHL) to add demand surcharges on some international routes, likely raising logistics and shipping costs ahead of the holiday season.

### Grain
USDA September WASDE lowered the domestic corn stocks-to-use to 13.1% while raising production to 16,814m bu but trimming yields to 186.7 bu/ac and increasing planted acres to 98.7m, with healthy condition ratings and high inventories likely weighing on corn prices.
