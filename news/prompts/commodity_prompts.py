    Prompt for multi-commodity market reports

    Args:
        groups_str: Comma-separated list of commodity groups

    Returns:
        str: Formatted prompt for commodity analysis
    """
    return f"""You are a financial analyst analyzing a chemical and agricultural markets report.

Extract relevant news for each commodity group and return ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:

{{
  "Group Name": "news summary for this group (or empty string if no relevant news)",
  "Another Group": "news summary..."
}}

Commodity Groups to check: {groups_str}

Instructions:
- For each group, extract ONLY news about: price movements, supply/demand dynamics, market fundamentals
- IGNORE: company-specific news (unless directly affects commodity prices), stock performances, general corporate announcements
- If no relevant news for a group, use empty string ""
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text
- Keep each summary to 1-2 concise sentences maximum
- When making cross-sector connections, focus on the COMMODITY IMPACT, not the mechanism: extract the effect on supply/demand/prices but omit operational details from other sectors (e.g., for Oil, mention "increased exports" but not "VLCC rates rose 34%"; for Iron Ore, mention "restocking activity" but not "Capesize rates jumped")

NOTE
- PVC: Refers to all plastic products (PE, PP, etc.). Any news about plastics should be included under PVC.
- Classify by shipping type — Container (SCFI, CCFI, WCI, TEU, FEU, Transpacific, Asia–Europe), Dry Bulk (BDI, Capesize, Panamax, Supramax, Handysize, iron ore, coal, grain, tonne-miles), and Liquids Shipping (aka Tankers) (BDTI, BCTI, VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax, LR, MR, crude, product tankers). Include mentions of freight rates, TCE, fleet growth, and demand-supply balance.
